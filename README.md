# SteamID-NET
C# .NET steam id converter engine with a useful lightweight example app.

I kinda felt compelled to make this because there were no public available DOTNET libs.

Converts any current SteamID to any other type.

Included in a lightweight app that showcases the conversion, plus the source to see how to use.
